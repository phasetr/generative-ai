##Example of ChatGPT giving a feedback on an intro for an essay.
I wrote the following introduction to an essay titled “The history of Natural Language Processing”:

Natural Language Processing (NPL) is a field of Artificial Intelligence whose purpose is finding computational methods to interpret human language as it is spoken or written. The idea of NLP goes beyond a mere classification task which could be carried on by ML algorithms or Deep Learning NNs. Indeed, NLP is about interpretation: you want to train your model not only to detect frequent words, to count them or to eliminate some noisy punctuations; you want it to tell you whether the mood of the conversation is positive or negative, whether the content of an e-mail is mere publicity or something important, whether the reviews about thriller books in last years have been good or bad.

Give me a feedback and some suggestions to improve it. Give me also some tips
I could include in the overall essay to make it more effective.
