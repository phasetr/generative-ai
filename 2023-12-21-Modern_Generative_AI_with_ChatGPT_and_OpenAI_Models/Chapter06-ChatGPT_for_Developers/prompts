## Example of ChatGPT generating a Python function to write into csv files.

generate a python function that add a line to all my csv files saved within "my_folder". The line should be the name of the csv file.

## Example of ChatGPT generating SQL schema for SAP tables

I have to SAP tables with the following columns.

MARA table: MATNR	ERSDA	ERNAM	AENAM	AEDAT	LAEDA	LVORM	PRDHA	STPRS	PEINH	BWTAR	MEINS	BSPGE	BKLAS	SERNP	SOBSL	SPART	MBRSH	MTPOS_MARA


VBAP table: VBELN	POSNR	MATNR	KDMAT	VRKME	LFIMG	WMENG	VRKMG	NETWR	WAERK	KZWI1	KZWI2	KZWI3	KZWI4	KZWI5	FKIMG	NTGEW	BRGEW	GEWEI	VOLUM	
generate a SQL schema for the above VBAP and MARA SAP table making relationships

##SAP tables columnsâ€™ renamed by ChatGPT.
rename the above columns with more human-understandable names

## SQL schema with renamed columns
recreate the sql schema for the two tables with renamed columns. If there are columns with same name, add a numeric indicator with an underscore at the end of the name

## ChatGPT generating optimized alternatives to a Python script.
I wrote the following script to filter a list only for odd numbers.

elements = list(range(1_000_000))
data = []
for el in elements:
  if el % 2 != 0:
    data.append(el)


Can you create a script to achieve the same result in lower execution time?

## Debugging Python function

I wrote this python function to add an underscore after each letter of a word. 
The expected result for the input word should be w_o_r_d_.

def add_underscores(word):
    new_word = "_"
    for i in range(len(word)):
        new_word = word[i] + "_"
    return new_word

phrase = "gpt"
print(add_underscores(phrase))

can you debug this code?
