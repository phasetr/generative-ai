## ChatGPT analysing a customer review
I recently purchased the RunFast Prodigy shoes and have mixed feelings about them. On one hand, the shoes are incredibly comfortable and provide great support for my feet during my daily runs. The cushioning is top-notch and my feet feel less fatigued after my runs than with my previous shoes. Additionally, the design is visually appealing and I received several compliments on them.

However, on the other hand, I've experienced some durability issues with these shoes. The outsole seems to wear down rather quickly and the upper material, while breathable, is showing signs of wear after only a few weeks of use. This is disappointing, considering the high price point of the shoes.

Overall, while I love the comfort and design of the RunFast Prodigy shoes, I'm hesitant to recommend them due to the durability issues I've experienced.

Analyze the sentiment of the above review. Overall, how do you classify it?
